This project I wanted to make something resembeling snowflakes I wanted to add more branches however due to a lack of time 
I was unable to do so. you can change certain parameters to for example the for loop parameters inside the draw function to
make different thing.
the main idea here is the snowFlake object and how it uses recursive algorithem to make the shape resembel snowflakes.
