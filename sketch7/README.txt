This is my interpretation of conway's "game of life", I tried to take
the rules from conway's "game of life" and code it myself as well as adding
random seed(beginig) to it. While Im not sure if my implimentation was correct
since my result seem different, still I think it looks very intersting. 
however please  let me know if I have done something wrong. I would still 
like to work on this and see if I can add an element of faction to it.
