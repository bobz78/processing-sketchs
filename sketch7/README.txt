This is my interpretation of conway's "game of life" meaning I tried to take
the rules from conway's "game of life" and code it my self as well as adding
random seed(beginig) to it. While Im not sure if my implimentation was correct
since my result seems different. so please let me know if I have done something
wrong but it still looks very intersting in my oppinion just different.
I would still like to work on this and see if I can add an element of faction
to it.
