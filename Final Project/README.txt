For this project I had something much more ambitious in mind where there
would be 2 or 3 different physics simulations separated in the screen and
each of these simulations are interactable however this was much more
complicated then I thought.

The idea was a rigidbody physics where you have
2D rectangle moving like a box colliding rotating and generaly moving how 
you would excpect. I managed to get the rotational force/torque (credit to: 
Nilson Souto Video Game Physics Tutorial) but not much else. right now you 
can click on the screen and drop a box on top of a handle and the handle will 
rotate correctly.

The other one is a fluid simulation this one was very compilcated but I 
finally managed to get it work (credit to: Mike Ash Fluid Simulation for 
Dummies) I managed to get it work using the above mentioned resource.there is 
two different modes you can switch between by pressing "1"for mode1(default 
mode) and "2" for mode2 mode1 has the name of the course and you can drag your
mouse through it to add a wind effect to it and make it look like a fire and 
smoke effect creating the course name "MATH ARE CODE" the second mode is just 
the fluid simulation where you can hold/drage left mouse botton and creat 
smoke as well as change its color by pressing the right mouse botton. 
you can also higher "N" value and lower "scale" for a higher resolution
you can also higher "iter" for more accurate simulation and generaly
you can change density and velocity value for different fluid sims.
